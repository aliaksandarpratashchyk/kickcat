# KickCat Codex

This document is the *preferred* KickCat user manual.

It states a set of rules and recommendations, which aren't necessarily required for KickCat's stability, but ***CAN*** be adopted to ensure uniformity of all GitHub entities.

It is composed of several manuals, each for its corresponding GitHub entity:

- ["Label Design Manual"](./label.md)
- ["Milestone Design Manual"](./milestone.md)
- ["Issue Design Manual"](./issue.md)
